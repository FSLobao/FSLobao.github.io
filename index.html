            <h2>Life</h2>
            <p>Born in Brasilia, Brazi, lived most of my life there. Loads of fun on a suburb house in the early childhood, later moved downtown and manage to get a nice nerd life there. Got my first Atari and loads of fun going to Sears store to play with the computers on display. Finally got my first 8 bit computer, a TK 2000 and later an moved to an MSX. Worked as an office assistant to by a printer. experimented making explosives and rockets that drove my mother crazy and made a few burn scars on the kitchen.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Early on got the opportunity to live by myself and study in Campinas. Did some traveling, most of the time near São Paulo and Minas Gerais but also around South America, including a trip all the way to Ecuador, riding the overrated death train to Bolivia, camping by the titicaca lake, following the inca trail to machu picchu, the nazca lines and the peruvian desert all the way beyond Lima and crossing to Ecuador up to Quito and all the way back.</p>
            <p>Later went on to work abroad, living in England, Venezuela, Indonesia, Argentina. In between, several leisure trips around those countries and other places in Europe doing things I enjoyed, specially photography and hiking.</p>
            <p>Back to Brazil, still kept my hobbies and took opportunities to join projects that allow me to meet new people and new places, including small working trips around Brazil and to Peru, Chile, Canada, USA, Germany, France, South Korea, Japan and Spain. </p>
            <p>Somehow in all this I manage to keep a stable relationship with my wife, my partner and friend since my last year of grad school. Later we were joined by two beautiful daughters whose education took most of my free time but come to enrich this wonderful ride.</p>

            <h3>Intelligent Spectrum Monitoring Network</h3>
            <p>Aims to implement a system to automate and optimize a spectrum monitoring network operation using machine learning technics, including strategies to manage the data produced by such network in order to provide insight into the radio spectrum usage though new visualization and analysis strategies.</p>
            <p>Main strategy focus on the creation of estimates for the probability density functions (PDF) that model the communication channel through a basic bayesian network, such as MCMC ( Markov Chain Monte Carlo). Starting with no prior knowledge of the radio spectrum usage, the system progresses through successive approximations until a large number of samples is acquired and a PDF estimate is possible. The use of the estimated PDF allows for further optimization of the acquisition process based on specific reliability targets set by the user.</p>
            <p>PDF functions and channel usage patterns are shared between stations allowing for faster collection of data and further generalization of the models created by clustering of the individual PDF functions around centroids that represent specific usage patterns. The improved models based on the generalized functions may be used in future works to improve simulations and spectrum allocation strategies or to improve regulatory enforcement activities.</p>
            <p>As per architecture, the system uses microservices developed in C++ and Python running on linux servers, allowing for greater scalability. Data storage uses HDF5 format for better interoperability and easier data sharing. Complementary studies into radio spectrum ontologies was conducted in order to standardize as much as possible the metadata structure that is stored as attributes within each HDF5 file. Some of the most relevant metadata is and replicated into an MariaDB server that supports the graphical user interface (GUI). This GUI was  developed using Wagtail Content Management System (CMS) and Flask.</p>
            <p>The first system version is intended to be released on the third quarter of 2019 using MIT license model followed by related publications.</p>

            <h3>Telecommunications Service Regulatory Enforcement during Major Events </h3>
            <p>For a broad description of Anatel enforcement participation on major events, please refer to the Annexs on the Report <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/rep/R-REP-SM.2257-4-2017-PDF-E.pdf" target="_blank">ITU-R SM.2257-4</a> and <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/rep/R-REP-SM.2257-3-2015-PDF-E.pdf" target="_blank">Report ITU-R SM.2257-3.</a></p>
            <p>I had the opportunity to participate as a technical analyst and coordinator for several projects that were conducted on the period from 2011 to 2016 that enabled Anatel to perform its obligations on the rollout of major events in Brazil, specially the FIFA World Cup 2014 and the Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on 2016. </p>
            <p>Major contributions were related to the procurement of measurement equipment, specially mobile and transportable spectrum monitoring stations with AOA and TDOA direction finding capabilities, portable direction finders using directional antennas, mobile and transportable stations to evaluate the human exposure to electromagnetic fields (NIR) and various accessories, ranging from sticker tags to be used for equipment identification to antennas and real time spectrum analysers.</p>
            <p>Apart from the system specification in itself, those projects incorporated some interesting approaches to sustainability, including extended warranties and services that were designed to incorporate into the acquisition price, as much as possible of the total ownership cost.</p>
            <p>All reference documents are publically available at www.anatel.gov.br. Please contact me through one of the social media channels if you are interested on any specific measurement equipment requirement and contract strategy.</p>
            <h3>Equipment Calibration</h3>
            <p>Since 2000, I&#x27;ve worked on all projects related to quality control and measurement equipment calibration at Anatel. The initial effort was conducted as part of Anatels quality certification process to the ISO 9000 standard into which I also worked as lead auditor.</p>
            <p>Main general interest on this project include the different approaches to the service contract that were adopted throughout the various anua cycles, including variations on the service scope and control methods. Two versions of a web calibration control software were developed.</p>
            <p>The most recent projects associated with equipment calibration are publically available at www.anatel.gov.br. Please contact me through one of the social media channels if you are interested on an specific project but can&#x27;t find the document.</p>

                <p>On this study SAS Enterprise Guide and other analytic tools were used to evaluate different strategies to contract transportation services to assist Anatel operations on its 27 office locations. The report takes various sources of information for all 27 locations, including local price policies for taxi services, existing contracts and usage profile on several months, including distances and road conditions to conclude with recommendations on the ideal number of vehicles to be contracted as exclusively dedicated rental services and how much should be contracted as a temporary fleet, using standard rental services or taxi.

A distortion parameter intrinsic calibration procedure was conceived to be carried out by a prototype system with a central controller that can carry out the image processing tasks and adjust properly the calibration parameters. It is an efficient alternative to use TFT-LCD video monitors as calibration standards, because their flatness, homogeneous illumination, geometric stiffness and availability. The experimental results obtained with the proposed setup are based on the usual camera distortion models</em>&quot;.
